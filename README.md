# LLMs ðŸ“šðŸ¤–

Welcome to **LLMs**, a curated collection of tutorials, code examples, and learning resources focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT, LLaMA, Claude, Mistral, and more.

I'm a software engineer with a passion for AI, and this repo is my way of exploring, documenting, and sharing everything I'm learning about working with LLMs â€” from fine-tuning to building AI-powered applications.

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

- `tutorials/`: Step-by-step guides for using, training, and integrating LLMs
- `examples/`: Ready-to-run code snippets and project templates
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiments and visualizations
- `resources.md`: A growing list of articles, tools, datasets, and research papers
- `projects/`: Mini-projects and real-world use cases powered by LLMs

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Prompt engineering & advanced prompting techniques
- Using OpenAI, Hugging Face Transformers, and LangChain
- Fine-tuning and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Building LLM-powered apps (chatbots, assistants, etc.)
- Model evaluation, testing, and performance tips

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Most tutorials use Python (3.10+ recommended) and popular libraries like:

- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `langchain`
- `openai`
- `torch`
- `faiss` or `chromadb`

Set up your environment using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
